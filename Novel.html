          <p>At MedLabs, we believe that Research and Development is at the core of everything we do. It is our pursuit to enrich lives globally by meeting the unmet medical needs. Our continuous efforts have resulted in a strong pipeline of specialty products and novel molecules focused in three key therapeutic areas of dermatology, oncology and respiratory. We are working on an exciting pipeline of specialty products primarily in the respiratory and dermatology categories. Presently we have several molecules, both New Chemical Entities (NCEs) and New Biological Entities (NBEs), in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development. MedLabs has made its mark in the discovery of novel molecular entities by out-licensing its own molecules to large multinationals. We have successfully out-licensed 7 molecules to 5 companies and have received a total of USD 217 million in up-front and milestone payments cumulatively.</p>

          <p> MedLabs is the only company from emerging markets to execute multiple deals on novel molecules.</p>

			<p>Our endeavor is catalyzed by a strong research infrastructure and an in-house team of experts. Our R&D center in Navi Mumbai, India is focused on discovery of New Chemical Entities and the Switzerland R&D center is focused on discovery and development of New Biological Entities. We have also developed our own proprietary platform for production of bispecific antibodies called BEATÂ® at our Switzerland R&D Center. Our global R&D capabilities are also reflected by the fact that we have approved clinical trial sites in over 20 countries.</p>
